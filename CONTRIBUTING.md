# Contributing

## Steps to contribute:

#### Clone the repo

**If you're part of the Women in Computing organization on GitHub**, you can clone the main repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Women-in-Computing-at-RIT/wichacks.io.git
```

Otherwise, fork the repo and then clone it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/wichacks.io.git
```

#### Make a branch for your changes

```bash
git checkout -b my-change-branch
```

### Make your changes

Modify any code you need!

#### Commit your changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my changes"
```

#### Push your changes up & make a pull request

```bash
git push -u origin
```

Then open https://github.com/Women-in-Computing-at-RIT/wichacks.io and you will see a green "Create pull request" button. Give the PR a title (your commit message works), summarize your changes in the description, and submit!

## Pull request lifecycle

Once you submit a pull request, several checks will run. These include tests to make sure everything works and linting for consistent code style. If one fails, don't worry - opening the results should be clear what went wrong, and if you're stuck on how to fix it just add a comment on the PR.
