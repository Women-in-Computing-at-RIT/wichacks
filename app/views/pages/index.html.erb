    <h2>About WiCHacks</h2>
    <p>
      WiCHacks is an all women 24-hour hackathon hosted by Women in Computing at RIT. A
      <b>hackathon</b>
      is a collaborative programming event in which participants create an app, website, game, or other piece of software over the course of the event.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>This event is open to women of all skill levels:</b>
      those who haven’t programmed at all, women who have done some programming, and the best women programmers out there. It will be a great day to learn, invent, and create the future.  Don’t have a team in mind?  No worries -- RIT Women in Computing will be hosting a series of events (including one on the morning of the event) to facilitate team formation. All meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) will be provided, and participation is free!
      <b>All participants must be female college students (at RIT or another university).</b>
